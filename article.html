    <h1>5 Crazy Future Tech Trends to Start Preparing for Now</h1>
    <p> Right now, we have the unique opportunity of looking at new technology.We can look at these technologies and predict just how much they will change society. 
    here are five crazy future tech trends to start preparing for now!<br>
    “The Internet of Things means that soon are not only will our phones be smart, but so will our cars, our fridges, and everything else in our house,” says Selepak.
   
    <h2> 1. Virtual and Augmented Reality</h2>
    <p> Virtual reality is already here. Samsung has been leading the charge with consumer VR with the Samsung Gear VR for the Galaxy S6 and S7 
    lines supporting virtual reality applications already. These apps include games like Minecraft, as well as entertainment applications. 
     It’s great to see these things finally hitting the scene after years and years of hearing talk about them,
     The application for VR is limitless it seems and, as more realistic virtual environments come into play,
      we can expect to see it more in training scenarios and education as well.<br>
      <br>Augmented reality, on the other hand, has not quite reached peak popularity yet. Sure, Snapchat filters that change your face into
       a dog counts, sort of, and Pokemon Go! showed promise. But while Google Glass showed us what the world could look like with a virtual 
       overlay, it brought short-lived hype along with it. The world wasn’t ready for universal AR glasses and has stuck with
        purpose-specific AR headsets for now.
     </p>

   <h2> 2. Artificial Intelligence</h2>
   <p>Smart homes. Smart cars. Smart…everything! Nowadays, it seems like it’s impossible to get away from the “smart” trend,
    and for good reason: everything is connected to the Internet, recording and sharing data automating itself based on that data, and doing things that we previously reserved for science fiction. 


    </p>
    <h2> 3. Transhumanism </h2>
    <p>The worst part about VR and AR are those clunky headsets that you have to wear, if you ask me… but what if I told you that in the
     future you won’t have to wear those headsets to see VR/AR? What if I took it a step further and told you that you’ll be able to make phone 
     calls just by tapping your ear and listening to signals vibrating through your jaw bone? What about sending emails with your mind?
